This project is built using the [React Portfolio Template](https://github.com/ryanbalieiro/react-portfolio-template) by Ryan Balieiro as a starting point. A huge thanks for providing such a great foundation!

Why This Template?
I explored several static site generators but found that I simply wanted a React-based setup with:

- Basic sidebars for easy navigation
- Timelines to showcase experiences or projects
- A structure that allows rendering and displaying data from JSON

This template happened to have all the features I was looking for, making it the perfect starting point for my portfolio.
